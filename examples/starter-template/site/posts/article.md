Remember that you can build this site using stack: `stack build && stack exec build-site`

Looks like you got [SitePipe](https://github.com/chrispenner/sitepipe) up and running! Congrats!

Here's a few next steps you could take:

- Read the docs on the [Github Page](https://github.com/chrispenner/sitepipe)
- Try adding a few more posts like this one!
- Add some CSS or JS to your site!
- Try hosting your built site on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!
